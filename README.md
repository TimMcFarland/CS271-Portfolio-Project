# Low Level Programming with String Literals

- Language:     MASM
- Dependencies: Irvine Library (http://asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2017/index.htm)


Using string literals, this program will receive string input from the user. The program then converts the string to an integer and displays that integer to the screen.
The program takes an amount of inputs defined in the program (currently 10) and outputs the numbers that the user input, the sum of those numbers, and the average of those numbers.
